# Daniel-Yang-Challenge1

## Description

The major purpose for Module 1 Challenge is to make the HTML and CSS codes more cleaner, and improve the structure and arrange the elements in order by structure.
The original codes contains a lots of duplicate codes and elements, so I renamed most of the elements and merge the css code to make it cleaner and easier for other user to see and also add the remark above each section to show this is "main", and now we are at "aside", etc.
I've learned alot about the debuging the unnecessary code by read the html codes in the beginning to see the how structure, and follow the codes to find where the class elements in css code. Therefore, I am able to optimize the css code. Also, I looked back into the past lesson professor taught and googled anything if I have questions.
